# Handling Transmission Failures (Resilience)

- High latency and packet loss
- Use `arrow.resilience.Schedule` to implement retry and backoff mechanisms when messages fail due to temporary disruptions (e.g., cosmic interference).

# Ensuring Message Delivery Order (Functional Streams)

- Use `arrow.fx.coroutines.Stream` to maintain ordered message streams and process them sequentially, preventing out-of-order execution due to network latency.

# Encoding and Decoding Data (Optics & Either)

- Use `arrow.optics` to define lenses/prisms for safely transforming structured messages.
- Use Either<EncodingError, EncodedData> to handle encoding failures without exceptions.


# Handling Missing or Corrupted Data (Option & Validated)

- Immutable data structures for reliability
- Use Option<Data> to represent optional message payloads when some data is missing.
- Use Validated to accumulate multiple errors in a message and decide whether to resend or repair the transmission.

# Asynchronous Command Execution (Arrow Fx Coroutines)

- Use suspend functions with arrow.fx.coroutines.parMapN to send multiple messages in parallel while managing independent transmissions.
- Coordinating State Between Ships (Sagas & STM)

# Error handling across distributed systems

- Use `arrow.resilience.sag`a to model transactional exchanges (e.g., confirm receipt before sending the next message).
- Use STM (Software Transactional Memory) for shared state synchronization when both ships modify a common data set (e.g., a shared mission log).
